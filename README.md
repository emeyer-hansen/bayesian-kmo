The Bayesian KMO (BKMO) index is introduced in the research paper *Revisiting ‘Little Jiffy, Mark IV’: Towards a Bayesian KMO index* (newest version published June 4th, 2025). This paper subscribes to the open science standard and is made freely available, in PDF-format (see the 'Newest'-folder) and [HTML-format](https://emeyer-hansen.github.io/bayesian-kmo/).

## Abstract

The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) index is a measure of sampling adequacy used by researchers to assess whether a data matrix is factorable prior to a factor analysis. Since its conception, the KMO index has remained a Frequentist statistic, leaving researchers unable to employ the advantages of Bayesian inference when assessing sampling adequacy. Building on the increasing relevance of the Bayesian statistical approach, as well as advancements in Markov-Chain Monte Carlo methods, the author proposes a re-conceptualization of the KMO index within the Bayesian framework that enables researchers to incorporate prior information and make coherent probabilistic statements about the sampling adequacy of a data matrix.©
